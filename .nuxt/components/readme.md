# Discovered Components

This is an auto-generated list of components discovered by [nuxt/components](https://github.com/nuxt/components).

You can directly use them in pages and other components without the need to import them.

**Tip:** If a component is conditionally rendered with `v-if` and is big, it is better to use `Lazy` or `lazy-` prefix to lazy load.

- `<UiAlert>` | `<ui-alert>` (components/ui-alert.vue)
- `<UiDateForm>` | `<ui-date-form>` (components/ui-date-form.vue)
- `<UiPopUp>` | `<ui-pop-up>` (components/ui-pop-up.vue)
